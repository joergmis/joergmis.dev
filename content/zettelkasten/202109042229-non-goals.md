Goals are important - without doubt - but so are non-goals. They are a way to
manage scope and expectations which are not often clearly communicated. Stating
and discussing non-goals helps to avoid misunderstandings and provide clarity
for all people involved:

- software engineers get a better feeling for the scope
- stakeholders know which features to expect
