In [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpJpjlLze5k) Nathaniel Drew
talks about the key points that he uses to re-invent himself in 2021.

- don't wait for things to happen
- love of one's fate: don't ponder why something happens, appreciate the
  opportunities it brings
- pay closer attention: be more present, reflect more often (anything with real
  value takes time)

The first two have in common that you need some kind of courage; courage to
take matters into your own hands, to be active and not passive. Everybody knows
the saying "Life is to short ...". It is a choice that needs courage to accept
life the way it is, how you became who you are and landed in your current
situation. You have the opporunity to activly change where the live leads you.
