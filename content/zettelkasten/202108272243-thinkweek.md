Test

There is always a cost of keeping up with the latest news / every message. The
bad thing is the life that is constantly interrupted - not the one time in 
itself. It adds up and degrades the quality of life (losely from Nathaniel's
video linked below).

Other stuff to look at:

- thoureau -> cabin in the woods
- cal newport -> deep work
- procrastination - from where does it come from? why do we procrastinate? is 
  it that we run from some messy truth that we alredy susprect deep down?
