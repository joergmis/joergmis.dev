## Intro

The actor model is a mathematical model to reason about highly concurrent 
systems. It is built-in to languages like Erlang or Scala, but with a little
effort can easily added to a go application.

Advantages of the actor model:

- good for highly concurrent systems
- easier to reason about
- easier to write

Basics:

- each actor has its own loop -> goroutine
- each actor has a mailbox on its own -> channel
- each actor sends messages to other actors
- actor can designate the behaviour to be used for the next msg it receives ->
  maybe for state machines

Advantages:

- by associating one goroutine (loop) with one actor you have given it an 
  identity -> useful for debugging
- no locks / unlocks

Disadvantages:

- debugging / testing might get harder (if you did not have a goroutine 
  beforehand)
- single reader / writer (enforces a single thread of control)

## Basic implementation

```
type Actor struct {}

func StartActor() *Actor {
  ch := make(chan action, size)
  actor := &Actor{}
  go actor.loop(ch)
  return actor
}

func (actor *Actor) DoSomething() {
  actor.actionChan <- something
}

func (actor *Actor) loop(ch <-chan action) {
  for {
    action := <-ch
    // deal with the action
  }
}
```

There are a few key questions; what is in the channel and how big is the 
channel? If you encode types of messages as for example integers you have a 
hard time extending the code.

## More detailled implementation

```
type action func()

// You can easily extend this - simply add a new method and put the logic in
// the anonymous function. It also runs async.
func (actor *Actor) Add(address string) {
  actor.action <- func() {
    actor.addConnection(address)
  }
}

// No locks necessary.
func (actor *Actor) loop(ch <-chan action) {
  timer := time.NewTimer(duration)
  for {
    select {
    case action := <-ch:
      action()
    case <-timer.C:
      retryConnections()
    }
  }
}

// Ask the actor for something. Blocking for the person who asks, the actor
// however will process it once he has time.
func (actor *Actor) String() string {
  result := make(chan string), 1)
  actor.action <- func() {
    result <- actor.status()
  }
  return <-result
}

// Non-blocking send (but action is lost)
func (actor *Actor) Try() {
  select {
  case actor.action <- func() {
    // do something
  }:
    // nothing to do here -> channel was open
  default:
    // channel is full
  }
}
```

*Note on channel size: 0 -> sender can't proceed until receiver receives it, 
1-n -> allowed and allows for async communication (until the channel is filled,
at least), unlimited -> not allowed by go*
