The best recipe I have come across so far in regard of sugar / salt
proportions.

- 1kg flour
- 43g yeast
- 2 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 120g butter
- 6dl milk

Melt the butter in a pan and remove it from the heat. Add milk, stir, crumble
and add the yeast. Stir until the yeast has disolved.

Add everything (preferrably with the milk mixture still a bit warm) into a bowl
and knead until you have dough. Place a wet towel over the bowl and let it rest
for around 1.5 - 2 hours.

Bake at 240Â°C for ~20min.
