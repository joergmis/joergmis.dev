## Intro

- the movement started in Paris with a group of artists in the 19th-century
- the term was coined by a critic who wrote a satirical review about *Claude
  Monet*'s *Impression, soleil levant* painting
- *impressionist music* and *impressionist literature* soon followed
- impressionism pathed the way for various other styles such as
  - neo-impressionism
  - post-impressionism
  - fauvism
  - cubism

## Context

- academic painters preferred
  - historical subjects, religious themes and portraits
  - paintings that looked realistic from short distance -> precise brush 
  strokes
- there was an annual, juried show (curated by academics) where painters could 
  display their work and win prizes and prestige
- *Claude Monet*, *Pierre-Auguste Renoir*, *Alfred Sisley* and *Frédéric 
  Bazille* had a shared interest in paining landscapes
- they went to the countryside to paint (but not sketches to be refined later 
  in the studio as academics would do - they finished the painting in the open
  air)
- the jury rejected about half of the work from the young painters
- *Emperor Napoleon III* saw the rejected work and decided that the public 
  should judge for themself -> *Salon des Refusés* was born and attracted more
  viewers than the original salon
- various artists founded *Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, 
  Sculpteurs, Graveurs* to open independent exhibitions - with mixed critical
  response -> one gave name to the movement
- the term quickly became popular and accepted by the public and the artists
- with the independent exhibitions, the artists did not become rich but the
  impressionism gradually achied public acceptance and support

In short, there was a well-defined way how art had to look and what motives 
had to be used. Multiple young painters had a spirit of independence and
rebellion - they wanted to paint other motives and not in the strict, known
style -> impressionism was born.

## Character

- small, thin but visible brush strokes
- visualising movement
- open composition
- focus on light
- broken-colour technique: leave different colours side by side, leaving it to
  the eye of the viewer to blend them together
