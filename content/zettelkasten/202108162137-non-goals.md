I came across this term on a tweet from Peter Bourgon where he talkes about
what you should and shouldn't think about when starting a project. The DOs:

> [...]
> - what problem are we solving?
> - who are the stakeholders?
> - what are the goals and especially non-goals?
> - what's the minimum viable feature set?
> - how do we measure success?

When looking at this list, it makes perfectly sense to *not* talk about what 
database you might want to use. After all, quoting him again:

> [...] is an implementation detail, which follows from the design, which follows from an understanding of the problem.

There are multiple phases from starting a new project to delievering it to the
customer. When looking at the code, the thread seems to be along:

> problem -> design -> implementation

But this is simplified and does not represent all that happens. The problem 
might look different for every involved stakeholder, which requires already at
the first stage quite some effort. Then again, if the stakeholders have limited
experience they might not be sure what they want but they still want progress.
