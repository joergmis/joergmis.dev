## Recursive algorithm

Call the algorithm with a smaller input set until the problem is solved.

Examples: fibonacci function (?).

## Divide and conquer algorithm

There are two parts:

- divide the problem into smaller problems
- solve the smaller problems and put them together

Examples: merge sort.

## Dynamic programming algorithm

This algorithm solves problems by breaking them into multiple subproblems, solves them once and stores them for future use.

Examples: fibonacci function.

## Greedy algorithm

The type is suited when you need to find a locally optimal solution. It does not guarantee a global optimal solution. In short, you use a selection function which is used to select the next best candidate.

Examples: Dijkstra (routing).

## Brute force algorithm

One of the simplest algorithms - try inputs until the problem is solved.

## Backtracking algorithm

The algorithm uses an incremental approach - problems are solved recursively. If one of the solution fails, the last step is reverted and the search is started again.
