## Intro aka Part I of the video

> Unhappiness is wishing that things were another way.

The unhappiness does not result from things being a certain way but rather from
your attachment to a specifc way of how you want things to be.

> Purpose, on the other hand, is about finding meaning, making sense of how 
> things are.

This shifts to a different view of life - you don't get to change the way the
life works. Wanting to do so - as mentioned above - makes you unhappy because 
it won't take place. You have more of an observer function and can take life
as it comes ("roll with the punches").

> If you wan't to be let's call it happy give it up let things be roll with the
> punches life is full of everything and you just need to experience it all.

## Framework aka Part II of the video

- attachment is a killer of joy
- attachment can come in various forms; for example: attachment to an outcome
- openness, spontanity and purpse are kind of the opposite, taking in what life
  throws your way

> joy = openness + purpose - attachment
