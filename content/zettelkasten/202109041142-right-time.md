We often spend time waiting for the right moment or the perfect opportunity.
Often it does not come - and we are disappointed. But why?

Every change inherently includes known and unknown factors. Let's take as an 
example switching jobs. There are many things you know that you might either be
uncomfortable with or need extended effort like saying that you'll leave or 
searching for a new job.

The point is that if you are not ready to commit to the decision, to the 
implications and possible consequences, you are not ready and the right moment 
will not come. How could it since you are not ready?

There are two ways to go about it; push yourself [(see amor fati)](/zettelkasten/202108272222-amorfati) 
or give yourself the space needed until you are ready to step forward.

What's important to recognize is that the right time depends on you, not 
something else.
