Ever since switching from an iPhone 12 Mini to an Android phone, I missed the 
fluid animations of the iPhone. They are just so good! But luckily, turns out 
there are a few things that you can tweak on Android to make the experience at
least somewhat similar:

- change window, transition and animation scale all up to 1.5x
- enable predictive back animations

With just these adjustments in the developer settings, the phone feels much 
more fluid.

Note that this was tested on an Asus Zenfone 10 - I can't say how this 
translates to other phones.
