## Introduction

> A deep life is a good life.
-- Cal Newport

This is a sentence borrowed from the introduction where he explains what lead 
him to write this book; his attraction to depth. Depth, so he claims, is at the
same time becoming more rare as well as more valuable to our economy. In his 
book he explores if his hypothesis is true (part I) and ways to take advantage 
of this reality (part II).

Newport is able to explain and puts it into words what I could not articulate 
exactly; how (constant) distractions such as social media affect our live. His 
claims are backed up by research and popular figures throughout history which 
are new leads if you want to dive deeper into specific topics such as the 
attention residue. He is also able to explain seamingly contradictory evidence;
for example why Jack Dorsey also does valuable work despite not having the time
to perform deep work.

Below are some condensed notes, starting with Newports definitions and his 
hypothesis. This should give you already a good overview of what this book is 
all about:

- **Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of 
  distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their
  limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to 
  replicate.
- **Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often 
  performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value 
  in the world and are easy to replicate.
- **Deep Work Hypothesis**: The ability to perform deep work is becoming 
  increasingly rare at exactly the same time is is becoming increasingly 
  valuable to our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill,
  and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

## Part I: the idea

### Deep work is valuable

- 3 kind of people thrive in our culture and economy:
  - high skilled workers; people who can interact with intelligent machines
  - superstars; globalisation and better communication technology allow local 
    companies to hire the best of all workers
  - owners; people who have the money to invest
- the high skilled worker and superstar kind are accessible with the following 
  skills:
  - ability to quickly master new things
  - ability to produce (speed as well as quality wise)
- high quality work = time spent x intensity of focus
- working on a single task for a long period of time is beneficial because it 
  minimizes the impact of the attention residue (attention residue - when 
  switching tasks, the attention does not follow directly).

### Deep work is rare

- there are different trends in todays business world: open floor offices, 
  instant messaging (such as slack) and the expectation that people are present 
  on social media.
- the trends highlight a paradox; deep work is increasingly valuable but it is 
  seldomly promoted by the businesses. There are multiple reasons:
  - metric black hole: as tasks get complexer it also becomes increasingly 
    difficult to measure the performance. This makes it hard to see how the 
    following principles degrade performance.
  - principle of least resistance: instead of crafting valuable messages, often 
    people tend to just ‘get it out’ of their inbox.
  - busyness as a proxy for productivity: the work of knowledge workers is 
    rarely visible, they therefore often tend to do things in a visible manner 
    (but those tasks are often not important).
  - cult of the internet: deep work builds on values like quality, 
    craftsmanship and mastery. They are old-fashioned and at a disadvantage 
    compared to new and upcoming tech because it simply seems impossible for 
    people to not embrace modern technology and with it, (almost always) 
    distracting behaviours.

### Deep work is meaningful

- there are arguments that depth is satisfing:
  - neurological: our mind constructs our world around what we pay attention 
    to. Pay attention to the bright side, to what makes you upbeat and your 
    life will become more pleasant.
  - psychological: research from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that 
    designing your workday around deep work and flow experiences is a proven 
    path to satisfaction.
  - philosophical: craftsmanship is a path to meaning. If you hone your 
    ability, apply it with respect and care, then you can generate meaning in 
    your daily work.

## Part II: the rules

### Rule I: work deeply

- choose a depth philosophy that fits your schedule and work:
  - monastic: reduce or eliminate all shallow work
  - bimodal: divide the time (possible on different scales) into defined 
    stretches of deep work and leaving the rest open for everything else. 
    During the deep work strechtes, it is the same approach as in the monastic 
    approach.
  - rhythmic: this model is based on minimizing energy needed to start deep 
    work by creating a rhythm. The chain method (with red crosses on the 
    calendar) can be helpful.
  - journalistic: journalists are trained to shift into a deep working mode 
    from one moment to another. This approach is hard since it deplets much of 
    your willpower if you are not trained to switch fast and regularly.
- ritualize: strict rituals ease the process to go deep and stay there longer. 
  Parts of the ritual:
  - the location & time: office, morning, …
  - the process / structure of your approach to work: switch off phone, grab a 
    cup of coffee, …
  - support your effort: food, beverages, ‘Do Not Disturb’ Sign, …
- make grand gestures (= serious commitment) to help to create importance 
  around the task.
- focus on the wildly important instead of trying to achieve everything -> 
  leads to simplicity and helps to focus.

### Rule II: embrace boredom

- be lazy: Idleness is not just a vaction […]. Regular freedom is useful due to
  a variety of reasons.
  - studies show that the unconsciousness is able to do better informed 
    decisions about problems that are vague and may have conflicting 
    constraints.
  - downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply (although some 
    argue that you only have to switch between tasks -> see quotes at the end).
- the ability to concentrate and perform deep work is an ability that must be 
  trained. Distractions should be avoided all the time (similar to junk food 
  for athletes).
- studies of Clifford Nass have shown that people who are always multitasking 
  (compared to non-multitasking subjects) are not able to filter out 
  irrelevancy. Their brains have been rewired so that they even can’t 
  concentrate when they want to.
- use other types of training to improve the general ability to concentrate - 
  for example, memorizing a deck of cards

### Rule III: quit social media

- the “any-benefit appraoch” should be avoided for new technology. There are 
  distractions lurking everywhere.
- apply a “craftsmen approach”: determine the core factors that determine 
  success and happiness in your personal and professional life. Only adopt a 
  new tool if the positive impact outweighs the negative impact.
- don’t use internet to entertain yourself: use the remaining hours before / 
  after work like another day because:

> [the time outside of work hours], it will assuredly increase the value of the
> business eight. One of the chief things my typical man has to learn is that 
> the mental facultaties are capable of a continuous hard activity; the do not 
> tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in 
> sleep.
-- Arnold Bennett, cited in Deep Work

- the solution is simple: plan what you do in your leisure time.

### Rule IV: drain the shallows

- schedule every minute of your day: it ensures that you know when shallow work
  creeps in.
- finish your work by a fixed time: this leads you to organise your day, plan 
  ahead and reduce shallow work.
- become hard to reach and take control over tools like email:
  - make people who send you email do more work: add a sender filter (set low 
    expectations about if / when you will respond), add faqs / forms / fees 
    before you allow others to contact you.
  - do more work when you send or reply to emails: craft emails 
    process-oriented. No short mails; add information, notes and questions 
    which guarantee that the project comes as fast as possible to a conclusion.
  - some emails are not worth responding because they are ambiguous, not 
    interesting for you or simply nothing good (or bad) would happen if you 
    don’t respond.

## Takewaway and thoughts

- deep work has been present throughout history and is not a new idea (but it 
  keeps getting more important).
- deep work is beneficial for your happiness.
- the ability to perform deep work has to be trained. Rituals can help to get 
  into the “mood”.
- often times, busyness and shallow work is preferred / wanted / "necessary"
  because it makes visible that you work on something.
- most people max out at 4 hours per day in a deep work state.
- planning is a tool / skill that is helpful almost everywhere in life.
- distractions should always be avoided (even after work). They rewire your 
  brain and are reversing the effects of spending time focused.
- new tech should be evaluated “like a craftsman” would do. Select tools that 
  you can make work for you, not against you.

## Random quotes and excerpts

> Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to 
> another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s much 
> like as if you were writing a pom.
-- Santiago Gonzalez, cited in Deep Work

> To do it right, it is the most complicated thing I know how to make. And it’s
> that challenge that drives me. I don’t need a sword. But I have to make them.
-- Ric Furrer, cited in Deep Work

> [Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants.
-- David Brooks, cited in Deep Work
